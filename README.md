# Hsiau-Yuhaya

Recorded Hsiauflute instrument samples (played by Yuhaya Wu 吳瑜駿).

We finally decided to make only 24bit-48kHz version available to the public. Reasons:

1. The samples are all originally recorded in 24bit-96kHz. However, frequencies higher than 24kHz are meaningless for storing effective audio information of this instrument.

2. Sample conversions (from 48kHz to 44100Hz) shouldn't bring troublematic performance problems while performing on today's computer hardwares.

We offer instrument formats for Sforzando, Presence XT and Kontakt (at least 5.6.6 R16, not the Kontakt Player but the full version).

It is fine to use all materials **FOR FREE** from this repository for either commercial or non-commercial **music production purposes only**.

This product is released under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Things need to beware:

- You should not sell these samples to others, because these are not yours.

- If you make these samples into virtual instruments, the virtual instrument must not be sold to others (due to the same reason above). Plus, you must credit that these samples are recorded from Yuhaya Wu 吳瑜駿's performance.

- You may ask for paid services to improve the quality of the virtual instrument you are using (e.g. Kontakt scripting). In such case, you have the responsibility not to leak the virtual instrument file to the public UNLESS the involved programmer(s) treat his/her/their work voluntary.

### Update History

#### [2017APR26] v1.01b

- Removed the overrecorded breath sounds among samples which could hinder the timbre beauty of the instrument.
- The ADSR parameters used in the Presence XT format of this instrument are now replaced by those parameters used in the Sforzando format and Kontakt format.
- Little bit trimming to the beginning of all audio samples for the sake of having a better MIDI performance.

#### [2017APR24] v1.01

- Using 24bit-48kHz in lieu of 24bit-96kHz to save some disk space occupation from useless frequencies.
- All samples are now precisely tuned (by using a free app called Polyphone, with manual corrections necessary).
- Every sample are now preliminarily have its useless frequencies filtered out. Further noise destructions may be performed in future updates.
- Kontakt patch is now made in monolith, due to reduced size of audio files. This won't significantly reduce its loading speed in Kontakt.
